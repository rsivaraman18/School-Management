# School-Management
This is a School Management System designed using Flask frame work.
I have Built this application using HTML, CSS, and BOOTSTRAP as a frontend.
Here I used python as backened.,Sqlite3 as a database and GIThub as a version control system to maintain the codebase.

This project maintains the student record by adding ,deleting,updating in the database.
This application provides separate login for both Admin as well as student.
This will automatically generate rank list based on the marks given by admin as wellas prepare special class list.
I have attached a video of its working..please do watch..
